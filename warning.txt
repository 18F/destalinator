Hey very quiet channel. We tend the channel garden by archiving channels that have been quiet for 30 straight days and this channel is one of them. Archiving a channel removes it from the list of active channels. That makes it easier for newer folks to find the right place to get their questions, answers and comments heard. Though the channel isnâ€™t open for further activity, the history is retained for easy browsing and searching. If you'd like to keep this channel active, SAY ANYTHING and we'll reset the timer. It's that simple. If we don't hear from anyone in the next 30 days, this channel will be archived.
